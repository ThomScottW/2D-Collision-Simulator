# Simple-Physics-Simlation

This is a python physics simulation that uses the Newtonian 1-Dimension collision equation to simlulate collisions in 2 Dimensions.
Credit to https://www.vobarian.com/collisions/2dcollisions2.pdf for the explanation behind the collision resolution.

This simluation uses the python third-party library Pygame for the visuals.

To run this, you need to create a folder with 2D_Collisions.py in it. Within that folder create another folder containing a python virtual environment with pygame installed. Once that is done, you can run 2D_Collisions.py and start observing the simulation.
